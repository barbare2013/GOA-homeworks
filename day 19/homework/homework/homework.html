    <p>Blackpink debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which included "Whistle", their first number-one hit on South Korea's <br>
    ircle Digital Chart, and "Boombayah", their first number-one on the US Billboard World Digital Songs chart. Three months later, they <br>
    released another single album, Square Two, whose song "Playing with Fire" was the first by a Korean girl group to enter the Billboard Canadian <br>
    Hot 100. The group's domestic and global popularity grew with the chart-topping single "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018), the first song by a Korean female <br>
    group to enter the UK Singles Chart and receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its music video was <br>
    the first by a Korean group to surpass one and two billion views on YouTube. Their music videos for "Kill This Love" (2019) and "How You Like <br>
    That" (2020) set records for the most-viewed music videos within the first 24 hours of release; the latter topped the Circle Digital Chart and <br>
    set five Guinness World Records.</p> <br>
