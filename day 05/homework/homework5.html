  <p>Sea animals, also known as marine animals, encompass a vast array of creatures that live in saltwater environments like oceans and seas.<br>
     These include fish, marine mammals like dolphins and whales, crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters,<br>
      and many other invertebrates like jellyfish and starfish. They are incredibly diverse, with over 260,000 known species,<br>
       and many more yet to be discovered, according to the World Wildlife Fund</p>
